# Unit Testing Rules

## Unit Testing Rules for AI Agent

### General Behavior
- The purpose of a unit test is to validate that code behaves correctly, not just to make the test pass.
- Do not write placeholder tests that assert `expect(true).toBe(true)` or equivalent. These are not valid tests.
- Only consider a test complete when it verifies meaningful behavior of the target code.

### Test Workflow
- First, (unless prompted to otherwise) list out the required test cases based on the function's expected behavior and edge cases.
- Then implement one test case at a time, ensuring it fails before the feature is implemented (if test-driven) or passes only when the feature works correctly.
- Do not skip test cases or stub them unless instructed to do so.

### Writing Tests
- Focus on observable behavior. Do not assert internal implementation details unless testing internal utilities.
- Test both success and failure paths where applicable.
- Use clear and descriptive test names that explain the scenario being tested.
- Avoid over-mocking or mocking code under test.

### Maintainability
- Keep test logic minimal and readable.
- Group related tests using `describe` blocks when appropriate.
- Use setup/teardown (`beforeEach`, `afterEach`) only when necessary to reduce duplication.

### Test Output
- Do not suppress or ignore test output or errors.
- Fail loudly and clearly when assertions fail—this is expected during test development.

## Framework Selection
- Use the testing framework configured in this project (e.g. Vitest or Jest). Do not mix testing frameworks.
- For Next.js/React: prefer Vitest for speed and ESM compatibility unless the project explicitly uses Jest.

## Test Organization
- Create a `__tests__` directory in the same directory as the files being tested.
- Place test files in the `__tests__` directory adjacent to the files they test with `.test.ts(x)` or `.spec.ts(x)` naming.
- Mock external dependencies and services.

## Test Coverage
- Aim for minimum 80% coverage on business logic.
- Test all user-facing components.
- Focus on testing behavior rather than implementation details.

## Testing Utilities
- Use @testing-library/react for component testing.
- Use msw for API mocking.
- Use @testing-library/user-event for testing user interactions.
- Create reusable test utilities and fixtures in a `test-utils` directory.

## Component Testing
- Test component rendering.
- Test user interactions.
- Test edge cases and error states.
- Don't test styles unless they're critical for functionality.

## Unit Test Structure
- Follow the AAA pattern: Arrange, Act, Assert.
- Keep tests simple and focused on a single behavior.
- Use descriptive test names that explain the expected behavior.

## Mocking Best Practices for Unit Tests

### When to Mock
- Only mock external dependencies (e.g., network calls, databases, third-party libraries).
- Do not mock internal application logic unless unavoidable.
- Mock time, randomness, or other non-deterministic behavior only if it affects test performance or reliability.

### What Not to Mock
- Avoid mocking business logic or pure functions from the same codebase.
- Do not mock framework behavior unless testing integrations.
- Do not mock simple utility functions unless strictly necessary.

### Guidelines
- Only mock methods actually used in the test.
- Do not assert on internal implementation details unless required.
- Use mock factories to reduce duplication.
- Reset or clear mocks between tests.

### Spies vs Mocks (Jest/Vitest)
- Use `vi.spyOn()` (or `jest.spyOn()`) when testing real implementations but verifying calls, arguments, or side effects.
- Use `vi.fn()` (or `jest.fn()`) to replace behavior entirely, especially for stubbing external dependencies.
- Prefer spies for methods on real objects where you want to preserve behavior and just observe usage.
- Prefer mocks for injected or standalone dependencies where behavior should be overridden.

### Code Hygiene
- Keep mocks readable and minimal.
- Extract complex mocks into helpers or factories.
- Use real implementations if they are lightweight and deterministic.

### Anti-patterns
- Do not mock the unit under test.
- Avoid mocking all dependencies by default.
- Avoid stale or unused mocks.
